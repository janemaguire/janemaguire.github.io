# My Portfolio

For my first portfolio site I went back to basics with HTML and CSS. This single page site features a static info panel so that contact details are always available as you scroll through projects.

This site features all my projects from the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly London, as well as a few other sites I have built using content management systems.
